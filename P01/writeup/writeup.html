# P01_Greedy IPS
## Problem Description
You work for Starmont Inc., a large-scale manufacturer of personal starships. As a feature for a new class of ship that your company is building, your manager has instructed you to make a program for the IPS (Interstellar Positioning System) that can chart the fastest flight path to a specified star system, taking into account the ship's max warp drive range. Knowing that the full capacity of the ship's warp drive (given in the input file) can be expended and recharged in a major system with a space station (also denoted in the input file) as many times as necessary along the way, build an algorithm that charts the shortest possible distance from the current location to the final destination in 3D space (using Cartesian coordinates), returning the star systems in order of visitation and the total traveled distance. Assume that you start out the trip with a fully charged warp drive.

## Input Specifications
The first line of the input file will contain the name of the current system, the name of the destination system, and a float (to 4 decimal places) of the max range of the ship's warp drive (which is not necessarily consistent, as different trim levels may have different propulsion units). Every subsequent line (of which there will be one per station) will contain the station name, decimal values of the X, Y, and Z coordinates (in that order, also to four decimal places), and a bool value of `1` or `0` to denote if a system has a space station. All input within a line is delimited a single space.

So, if you wanted to get from Blackmane to Cambria and also had Ariel and Alliance in your map, input would look like:
```
Blackmane Cambria 14.0000
Blackmane 136.8153 1898.6918 1617.6132 1
Ariel 139.9871 1893.4698 1611.1568 0
Alliance 142.6879 1891.1689 1612.9875 1
Cambria 148.6897 1892.4189 1605.1564 0
```

## Output Specifications
You should output the total distance that you'll travel along said route (to four decimal places) on the first line, followed by the route that you've calculated (one system per line, including both source and destination). If the route is impossible, print out `No Valid Route` and exit. If your start and end systems are the same, return the distance travelled (0.0000) and the system name.

For example, for the provided input above, the output should be:
```
20.5509
Blackmane
Alliance
Cambria
```

## Examples
### Example 1

Alliance 142.6879 1891.1689 1612.9875 1
Cambria 148.6897 1892.4189 1605.1564 0
```
#### Output
```
20.5509
Blackmane
Alliance
Cambria
```
### Example 2
#### Input
```
Blackmane Cambria 14.0000

Alliance 142.6879 1891.1689 1612.9875 1
Cambria 148.6897 1892.4189 1605.1564 0
```
#### Output
```
19.5118
Blackmane
Ariel
Cambria
```
### Example 3
#### Input
```
Blackmane Cambria 6.0000
Blackmane 136.8153 1898.6918 1617.6132 1
Ariel 139.9871 1893.4698 1611.1568 1
Alliance 142.6879 1891.1689 1612.9875 1
Cambria 148.6897 1892.4189 1605.1564 0
```
#### Output
```
No Valid Route
